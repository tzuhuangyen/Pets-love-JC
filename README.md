This project was initiated by my friend Jessica, a pet owner with a passion for providing healthier food options to her five dogs and five cats. To achieve this, she started making homemade pet food without chemical additives. However, the absence of preservatives limited the snacks' shelf life. Jessica initially shared her creations with neighbors, and their positive feedback motivated her to expand her business.

However, Jessica encountered a challenge in promoting her products with every new batch she made. To overcome this, I suggested creating a dedicated landing page for her pet snacks, eliminating the need for repetitive posts.

The website was developed using HTML, SCSS (Sass), Bootstrap, Swiper, EJS (Embedded JavaScript), and additional tools such as JQuery AOS Animate and Git for collaboration with the designer.
